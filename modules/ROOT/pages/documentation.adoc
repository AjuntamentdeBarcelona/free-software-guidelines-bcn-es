Free software projects are based on a whole series of technologies, working
methods and ways of collaborating but all that would not be sustained
without a very special legal mechanism: the free software licences.  The use
of such licences in itself guarantees a series of inalienable rights, which
allows a certain flexibility about the copyright policy.

== Ownership of the code copyright

:!measure:
:sect: 7.1

Until now, contracts with suppliers stipulated that all the software
developed for the City Council within the framework of the contract, and
associated documents, is owned by the Council.

With free software licences, even though one does not have legal ownership
of the source code, that code can be used as often as necessary and for
whatever task is desired, as well as modified, adapted and redistributed
(the latter under the conditions set by the licence).  So the City Council
could waive assignment of the copyrights in the code (provided it obtains
the code under a free software license), but for the moment we
conservatively continue claiming assignment as the default policy (apart
from the exceptions stated in the alternatives below).  The only two things
that are not possible to do without being the legal owner of the code is
relicense it or transfer the ownership.

The main criterion for assessing who should hold the copyrights in the case
of new projects, is to think which entity best ensures at each point that
the appropriate measures are taken to disseminate the project, facilitate
contributions from third parties, make it grow to achieve the objectives and
make it sustainable in the long term.

That is the default option but not the only one.  It forces the contractor
to assign ownership of the copyrights in the code and the documentation that
it generates.

It particularly makes sense that the City Council should wish to concentrate
all property rights on emblematic projects, principally used between public
administrations, and on those over which it intends to decide to a large
extent the rules of governance.

There is a third option if the aim is for ownership to eventually go to an
external organisation responsible for the running and governance of the
project in the long term.  Given the nature of the function, that
organisation will normally take the legal form of a foundation or other
non-profit entity.  This makes sense in projects where, besides the City
Council, other public, private or third sector bodies are involved
financially and in decision-making.  In this case copyright must be assigned
by contract, either directly to the corresponding entity, or initially to
the City Council, so the latter can assign copyright to the entity at a
later date.

The foundation can manage other projects freed by the City Council or of
other entities linked with the public sphere.

It makes sense to leave ownership in the hands of the company that develops
the software when:

Software components are for general use, including companies and not just
public authorities.

The supplier is a company or a cooperative with a track record of publishing
free software and running free software communities, and which has a
credible strategy for exploiting the product based on free software
licences.

== Choose a licence for the code

:!measure:
:sect: 7.2


There are three options, depending on the use-case:

* `NewProdct` or `Publication`: we choose the AGPL licence by default.

* `Adaptation`: we modify an existing project.  In this case we have to
  respect the licence it already has.

* `Plugin`: we choose a licence commonly used in the ecosystem in which we
  want to integrate a modular component.

.Use the AGPL-3.0 licence as the licence for distributing the project
--
[.tags]
* NuevoProducto
* Publicación


The https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html[GNU Affero General
Public License v3.0] (AGPL-3.0) has all the characteristics we need for City
Council projects:

It is a licence with copyleft, as required by Spanish law for public
authorities creating free software products, and as it is reasonable to
demand of them to prevent private appropriation of what has been financed
using public money.

For applications where users mainly interact via the internet, the law does
not allow the creation of a closed service using software with this licence
(it establishes internet access as a form of distribution for the purposes
of the licence).  This is sometimes called internet copyleft.

The licence’s governing body is the GNU project, the non-profit organisation
that works for the benefit of free software communities.  Therefore, it is
this group of activists and experts who will design future versions of the
licence (to adapt it to new legal and technical circumstances) and the legal
defence against possible attacks on the freedoms set out in its text.

The main reason for choosing this licence as the default option are as
follows:

* It belongs to the GNU GPL family of licences, which is the best known.  Most
  developers are familiar with its conditions, which means nobody will have to
  spend time researching the licence to decide if they want to participate in
  the project or not.

* Opting for more widely used licences reduces the risk of fragmenting this
  universal immaterial commons resource posed by free software, a risk caused
  by the proliferation of licences and their reciprocal incompatibilities.

.Use the EUPL-1.2 licence as the licence for distributing the project
--
[.tags]
* NuevoProducto
* Publicación


The https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/introduction-eupl-licence[European
Union Public License 1.2] (EUPL-1.2) is a licence created by the European
Commission.

The advantage it has over licences belonging to the GNU GPL family is that
it has legally valid translations for all the EU’s official languages:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12.[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12].
Its design has also taken into account the legal diversity of the member
states as regards copyright terminology, warranties and applicable
jurisdiction.

Just like the AGPL-3.0, it has copyleft and internet copyleft.  The copyleft
conditions it sets out in the case of linking with other products are softer
than those of the AGPL-3.0 and more like those of the LGPL.  However, many
legal experts think these differences are irrelevant before the European
courts.  The fine details of the differences with the GP-3.0 (and with the
AGPL-3.0 too) are explained at:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/eupl-or-gplv3-comparison-t.

Using this licence (in its latest version, 1.2) should pose a low risk of
fragmentation for the free software commons, as it establishes explicit
compatibility with the main families of licences with copyleft, including
the GNU licences.  You can find more information on EUPL 1.2 compatibility
with other licences at:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences.

The European Commission, through its Join Up initiative, is the licence’s
governance body.

*Drawback.* It is much less known and less widespread than the GNU GPL licences. Many developers may be hesitant about using it.
At best, they might be convinced that its conditions are very similar to those of the AGPL-3.0.
In the worst case scenario, they would prefer to contribute to another project that has a licence they are used to.

.Use the original licence for all code that modifies an existing component
--
[.tags]
* Contratar
* Adaptación

When we modify a component, and to ensure our modifications might
potentially be incorporated into the original product, we have to respect
the licence we are given, although we could modify it in the case of lax
permissive licences.

For development under contract, each circumstance needs to be specified in
the specifications.

If we have respected measure S_58B, the component we are modifying will have
a free software licence.

* Contratar
* Plugin

If we have to build a plugin to an existing platform (the core of which,
according to measure S_58B, has to be free), we have a certain margin for
choosing the licence.  It is best to choose one from among those most used
in the framework or platform in question, in order to facilitate the new
component’s acceptance by the community.  We are interested in more people
using and contributing towards maintaining our component.  So, if the AGPL
or the EUPL are among these more popular licences, we choose them.

The licence will go in plain text in a file called `LICENSE` (no extension),

The text of the two recommended licences (which should be copied word for

* https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.txt

* https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/EUPL%20v1_2%20EN(1).txt

The `LICENSE` has to be in English.  When using the EUPL-1.2 licence, which
has official translations, we have the option of including `LICENSE.ca.txt`
and `LICENSE.es.txt` files.  The different translations can be found at
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12.[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/page/eupl-text-11-12].

.Include a copyright and licence notice in each code file
--
[.tags]
* Adaptación
* Plugin
* NuevoProducto
* Publicación

Most licences stipulate the inclusion of a licence and copyright notice.

This means at the top of all repository code files (except build script and
installation files) there must be a notice that explicitly states which
persons or entities are the code’s copyright holders and which licence
establishes the distribution terms.

It is important to point out under which specific version of the licence it
is distributed, and we recommend stating that this will be automatically
updated to future versions when these are released (usually to adapt to
unforeseeable technological and social changes), with no need to update all
the code files.  In the examples given below, this is shown by clauses such
as “either version X of the License, or (at your option) *any later
version*” or “version X or – as soon they will be approved by the European
Commission – *subsequent versions* of the EUPL”.

Obviously, the notice must go in a comment, using the comment syntax each
program language uses.  And it must also include all the years when
modifications have been made to the file.  This would be an example, if we
use the AGPL-3.0 on Java code, assuming the copyright holder is Barcelona
City Council:

This means all the code in the repository has the permission of the person

If the code copyright holders have to be different from the authors (for
example, because Barcelona City Council is the holder) an assignment of
rights must be obtained.  This can be done in the following ways:
